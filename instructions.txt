The following uses an implementation of the SDES and SAES algorithm to perform some 
basic functions such as encryption, decryption and keyGeneration.

The programs accepts the following commands:

To generate key1 and key 2:
    py.exe kg 10-bit key

To encrypt:
    py.exe e (8-bit plaintext) key1 key2

To decrypt:
    py.exe d (8-bit cyphertext) key1 key2


To use the SAES function use the following commans as follow:
    -Keys, plaintext, and cyphertext must be 16-bit 
Decryption:
    py.exe saes d key0 key1 key2 cyphertext

Encryption:
    py.exe saes e key0 key1 key2 plaintext

Key Generation:
    py.exe saes kg key
